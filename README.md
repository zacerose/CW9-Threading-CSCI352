# CW9: Threading
Name: Zachary Rose  
Date: 3/2/2023  
Class: CSCI 352

Uses threads and the Monte Carlo method to estimate pi using a random number generator. User inputs number of throws and threads to use. 

## Required Files
* CW9-Threading/ --> directory containing the project files
* CW9-Threading.sln --> Visual Studio solution file
## Program Usage
To launch the program, clone the repository in Visual Studio and run by pressing "Start".  
When prompted, enter an integer for the number of throws for each thread, and an integer for the number of threads to run. Stay within bounds of a 32 bit integer
and your hardware.

## Design Decisions
* No input parsing was added, as it seemed beyond the scope of this project.
